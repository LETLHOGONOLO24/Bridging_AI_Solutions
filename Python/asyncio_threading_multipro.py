#1. Synchronous (Single-threaded) ->
#Tasks run 1 after another, each task blocks the next, simple, slow for I/O heavy work

#2. Threading
#Multi threads within 1 process, best for I/O

#3. Multiprocessing
#Multiple processes, each process has its own python interpreter


 #3 Synchronous Code Example (Blocking)
 #Problem: Tasks run one after another

#Output:
# Starting task A
# Starting task B
# Starting task C
# Finished task A
# Finished task B
# Finished task C
# Asyncio results

#What just happened?
#Feature -> Synchronous -> AsyncIO
#Excution -> One-by-one -> Concurrent
#Blocking -> Yes -> No
#Thread count -> 1 -> 1
#Speed -> Slow -> Fast 
#Best for -> Simple tasks -> I/O-bound tasks*


#Asyncio explained:
#great for:
#-> waiting for data from the internet
#-> waiting for a file read
#-> waiting for a timer

#This means:
#-> Task A starts
#-> Task B starts
#-> Task C starts
#-> All three are sleeping at the same time, instead of one waiting for another. 
#-> Total time is arounf 2 seconds, not 6 secs


#Without asyncio (normal code):
#-> Task A: wait 2 sec
#-> Task B: wait 2 sec
#-> Task C: wait 2 sec
#Total = 6 seconds

#With asyncio:
#-> Task A starts waiting 
#-> Task B starts waiting
#-> Task C starts waiting
#All sleep at the same time 
#Total = 2 seconds

#With asyncio, your program can do other things while waiting
#Summary:
#Thing -> Meaning
#async def -> creates an asynchronous function
#await -> "Pause here, let others run"
#asyncio.sleep(2) -> A non-blocking 2 second wait
#asyncio.gather() -> Run many async tasks together
#asyncio.run() -> Start the async event loop
